Zajal 0.4 - Amsterdam
=====================
Amsterdam is the first major rewrite of Zajal since the start of the project. It uses a brand new, all-Ruby architechture built on Rubinius and aims to be easier to hack, maintain, and expand on. Specifically, Amsterdam is designed to incorporate more easily with RubyGems and ofxAddons.

A lot still needs to be done. All it does is open a window and draw circles. Live coding is absent, too. Amsterdam won't be usable by the general public for a few more months. In the meantime, you should check out the very capable [public release](http://zajal.cc/) if you want to make things in Zajal.
